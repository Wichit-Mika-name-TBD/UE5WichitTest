# UE5 Wichit Test

# Installation

You need git with LFS support. You can find instructions on the
 Internet, e.g. from here: https://git-lfs.github.com/

Get the Unreal Engine from the Epic Launcher. You need Visual Studio,
because the project is a C++ project. You can use the community
version of Visual Studio from here:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Clone the project from git-bash:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mika314/UE5WichitTest.git
```

Open the file `UE5WichitTest.uproject` and let the engine recompile the
code.
